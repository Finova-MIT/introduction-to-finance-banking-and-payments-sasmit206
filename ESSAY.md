What is the most interesting thing I learned about money or finance this week, and how do I see it applying to my life or the world around me in 2025?

  Index funds might seem boring at first glance, but have consistently been a reliabe source of investment. The most interesting thing I learned this week is how consistently they have outperformed even the best investors in history. While hedge fund managers and stock-picking gurus make headlines, the simple, passive approach of tracking the overall market has quietly delivered superior long-term returns.

This ties into the idea of collective intelligence—the wisdom of the crowd. Rather than relying on the insight of a few brilliant investors, index funds tap into the knowledge and actions of millions of people participating in the market. No single investor can consistently outguess the entire market over decades, and history proves this. Even legendary investors like Warren Buffett have advised that most people are better off investing in index funds rather than trying to pick winning stocks.

What’s has been even more interesting is how this applies beyond finance as well. The principle of collective intelligence has forseen that when enough people contribute their knowledge and decisions, the result is often better than that of a single expert.
